# Education
---

- <ins>Ph.D. in Physics</ins>
  : University of Oklahoma, *July 2024*

- <ins>B.S. in Astrophysics</ins>
  : University of Oklahoma, *May 2017*

# Research Experience
---

- **<ins>Graduate Research Assistant</ins>** (July 2019 -- Present)
  : *University of Oklahoma, Advised by Dr. Eddie Baron*

  : My current research focuses on a statistical treatment of observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). As a result, I've identified correlations between many spectroscopic and photometric properties of these SNe Ia, which will aid in constraining models all around the scientific community.

  : **Publications**:
    : See [my publications]({% link _tabs/publications.md %}).

  : **Code Products**:
    : [`SNEx`]({% link _projects/SNEx.md %}) - Spectrum extrapolation into the near-infrared using PCA.

    : [`Spextractor`]({% link _projects/Spextractor.md %}) - Fast spectrum-smoothing using Gaussian processes; spectrum preprocessing; other useful features.

    : [`SNIaDCA`]({% link _projects/SNIaDCA.md %}) - Wrapper for classifying SNe Ia with Gaussian mixture models.

- **<ins>Undergraduate Research Assistant</ins>** (June 2015 -- May 2017)
  : *University of Oklahoma, Advised by Dr. John Wisniewski*

  : My work concentrated on the observation, reduction, and analysis of data taken of star clusters to improve our understanding of stars with variable circumstellar disks.
