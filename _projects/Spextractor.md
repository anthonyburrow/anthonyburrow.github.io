# About

Fork of the [original spextractor](https://github.com/astrobarn/spextractor) by Sem√©li Papadogiannakis.

This code uses Gaussian process regression to extract line velocities and pseudo-equivalent widths (along with RSi, etc.) of a given spectrum. Designed for Type Ia's, however mostly generalized for any given feature (see code).
