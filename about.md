### About Me

I graduated from the University of Oklahoma in the Department of Physics and
Astronomy with a Ph.D. in Physics. My dissertation topic focused on the
statistical modeling of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), creating empirical models
that describe the complex diversity of SNe Ia.

### My Research

Most of my research involves the application of advanced statistical methods
and machine-learning techniques to spectroscopic observations of SNe Ia. I am
a collaborator of the POISE/CSP group, whose primary focus is to discover
astrophysical transients at early phases. To aid my research, I also generate
models using different synthetic spectra and radiative transfer software. For
more information on my research, see
[my publications]({% link _tabs/publications.md %}) or even
[my resume]({% link _tabs/resume.md %}).

### My Interests

I'm very interested in both data science and software development. I have a
years of experience using Python and other C-based languages. I specialize in
writing software that employs vectorized Python and/or C++ to model data or
to derive physical characteristics of astronomical objects. I have
developed several Python tools in conjunction with my published research; check
out [my projects]({% link _tabs/projects.md %})!
