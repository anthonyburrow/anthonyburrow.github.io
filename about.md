### About Me

I am currently an astrophysics student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Oklahoma, and I will be graduating with a Ph.D. in Summer 2024. My thesis topic is focused on both theoretical and observational perspectives of Type Ia supernovae, creating empirical models that describe the diversity of Type Ia supernova diversity.

### My Research

Most of my research involves the application of advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques to spectroscopic observations of Type Ia SNe. I am also a collaborator of the POISE/CSP group, whose primary focus is to discover astrophysical transients at early phases. To aid my research, I also generate models using different synthetic spectra and radiative transfer codes. For more information on my research, see [my publications]({% link _tabs/publications.md %}) or even [my resume]({% link _tabs/resume.md %}).

### My Interests

I'm very interested in both the data science and software development. I am highly experienced with Python and other C-based languages (with 5+ years of experience). I specialize in writing numerical calculation software with vectorized Python, C/C++, and intertwining the two together. I have developed several Python tools in conjunction with my published research that utilize these skills. Check out [my projects]({% link _tabs/projects.md %})!
