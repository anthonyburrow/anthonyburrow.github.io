### About Me

I recently graduated from the University of Oklahoma in the Department of
Physics and Astronomy with a Ph.D. in Physics. My thesis topic focused on both
theoretical and observational perspectives of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia),
creating empirical, predictive models that describe the diversity of SNe Ia.

### My Research

Most of my research involves the application of advanced statistical methods
and machine-learning techniques to spectroscopic observations of SNe Ia. I am
also a collaborator of the POISE/CSP group, whose primary focus is to discover
astrophysical transients at early phases. To aid my research, I also generate
models using different synthetic spectra and radiative transfer codes. For
more information on my research, see
[my publications]({% link _tabs/publications.md %}) or even
[my resume]({% link _tabs/resume.md %}).

### My Interests

I'm very interested in both data science and software development. I have a
high degree of experience using Python and other C-based languages (with 5+
years of experience). I specialize in writing numerical calculation software
with vectorized Python, C/C++, and intertwining the two together. I have
developed several Python tools in conjunction with my published research
that utilize these skills. Check out
